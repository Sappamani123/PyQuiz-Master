# PyQuiz-Master
Developed a command-line Python quiz system featuring 10 multiple-choice questions using modular code structure. Implemented a scoring mechanism, performance evaluation (pass/fail based on 80% threshold), and dynamic user interaction for answer validation. Utilized custom functions and list-based question banks for flexibility and scalability.
